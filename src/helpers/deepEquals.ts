/**
 * This module provides the function [[deepEquals]] that allows to test
 * if two object are semantically equal. The module is loosely based on
 * [inspect-js/node-deep-equal](https://github.com/inspect-js/node-deep-equal)
 * but removing all dependencies.
 *
 * The function is intended for comparison of basic types, simple non classed
 * objects, arrays, and built-in basic classed objects such as Set, Map, RegExp,
 * Date, Buffer and Error.
 *
 * Note that deep equality is costly, and should be avoided whenever possible. Yet
 * is some scenarios, it may be useful to count with such a function. In that sense,
 * we provide a 'cheap' (in terms of dependency overhead) alternative to most
 * third-party implementations, that can be used through the whole project.
 *
 * Note that the implementation is kind of ugly and heavily procedural. The idea
 * behind the code is to return a result as fast as possible. Also note that it might
 * not consider the most edgy cases. If you have trouble with a specific case,
 * please consider sending a Pull Request or raising an Issue in this project's
 * repository.

/**
 * Answer wether or not two elements are equal, considering them
 * equal when they have the same type and all their internal elements are
 * the same, or when they represent the same concept (two regular expressions
 * that match the same string, to date for the same moment, to sets with same
 * elements in it, and so on).
 *
 * Most simple cases should return true as expected, such as:
 * * `deepEquals(1, 1.0)`
 * * `deepEquals({a: 1, b: {c: 3, d: 4}}, {b: {c: 3, d: 4}, a: 1})`
 * * `deepEquals([1,2,3], [1, 1+1, 2+1])`
 * * `deepEquals(new Set([1,2,3]), new Set([3,2,1]))`
 *
 * There is one special case, that we support and that might not be expected
 * in standard TS/JS behavior, which is `NaN` comparison. Here you might find
 * that `deepEquals(NaN, NaN)` is `true`, even though in JS NaN is not equal
 * to anything, even itself.
 *
 * Note that parameters are statically typed when running in TypeScript,
 * thus not allowing for things such as `deepEquals(4, '4.0')` to be typed,
 * unless explicitly casted away. In that case even, the comparison is performed
 * not considering type coercion, thus, returning false.
 *
 * If you want to see all supported and unsupported cases, we recommend you to check
 * out the test cases.
 *
 *
 * @param first The element to compare to.
 * @param second The element to compare against.
 *
 * @return `true` if both elements are equal, `false` otherwise.
